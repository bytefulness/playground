# Playground For Practise

## Practice Scenario: 

I've got a project. I'm going to upload it into the remote (GitHub) to show off and collaborate my colleagues. I'll get to the office and download into it my local from remote. I'll work on new feature and when it's done again I'll push it into the remote.

I hope everything go well :)

## Result:

Everything did go great. I've learned new thing about delete branch that is on remote through local terminal. 

$git push origin --delete branchName
